## Game Designer | Live Ops Specialist | Technical Artist

Hello, I'm **Ryan Dormanesh**, an experienced Game Designer based in the pacific northwest.

My career spans over a decade, evolving from the rich, immersive worlds of **AAA console development** (Rockstar San Diego's *Red Dead Redemption*) to the **analytics-driven domain of mobile games** and live operations. This journey has given me a unique perspective, blending passionate creative storytelling with the science of data tested design.

I have a proven track record in **Unity 3D**, **puzzle design**, and **Agile methodologies**, having:

* **Designed and launched levels and live events** for millions of daily players on global titles like *Cookie Jam* and *Perfect Swing Golf*.
* **Honed technical design skills** from managing complex state machines for dynamic animation systems to implementing live ops quest tools in the Unity Editor.
* **Driven key performance indicators (KPIs)** by translating player analytics into actionable insights, ensuring quality experiences, and mastering gameplay difficulty balancing.

Whether it’s crafting engaging level designs or overseeing a global mobile game launch, I am driven by a nuanced understanding of both the art and the metrics that define success in gaming.
