Hello, I am Ryan Dormanesh, a passionate game designer based in Bonney Lake, WA. Transitioning from the rich narratives and immersive worlds of AAA titles at Rockstar San Diego to the fast-paced, analytics-driven domain of mobile gaming, I've embraced the art and science of game creation. My journey has taken me from crafting dynamic state machines for Red Dead Redemption to designing levels and live events for Match 3 games.

 The move to mobile gaming opened my eyes to a different way of doing things, where data analytics merge with a business mindset to forge a 'scientific' approach to game design. This paradigm shift from purely creative endeavors to a blend of creativity and data fascinated me, leading to the strategic design of live event features and the agile delivery of content that kept millions engaged week after week.

 Within this realm, I've honed my ability to listen to players, translating analytics into actionable insights that resonate with audiences worldwide. From ensuring quality experiences on large e-commerce platforms to overseeing the launch of an Unreal powered mobile golf sim, my role has evolved but my core drive remainsâ€”the pursuit of excellence in game design, shaped by the nuanced understanding of both the art and metrics that make games successful.
