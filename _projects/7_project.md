As the lead QA for "Rockstar Presents: Table Tennis," I was pivotal in 'finding the fun' through focus group testing and enhancing test automation in collaboration with programmers. This strategic shift allowed testers to concentrate on more meaningful tests. My role included maintaining close communication with the producer, ensuring we met Microsoft's certification requirements for a smooth Xbox 360 launch. Our success in QA was integral to the game being part of the console's celebrated release lineup.
