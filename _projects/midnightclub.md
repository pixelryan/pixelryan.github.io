Breaking into the gaming industry as QA for "Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition," I quickly learned the dedication and hard work needed to succeed. The game's complexity, especially within its elaborate multiplayer modes like capture the flag, required extensive testing and overtime. Interestingly, "cruise" mode, which allowed players to freely roam—a precursor to the open-world experience later popularized by GTA Online—emerged as a fan favorite.
