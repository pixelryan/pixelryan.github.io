Welcome to "Guess Quest," the Higher or Lower card guessing game! Test your luck by guessing whether the next card in a deck will be higher or lower than the current one. Each correct guess earns a point, and successful streaks increase your score multiplicatively. Aim for a high score and then challenge yourself to surpass it!
