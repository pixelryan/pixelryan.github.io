### Twitch Plays Turtle Racing

Venturing into the unique space of interactive live-streaming games, "Twitch Plays Turtle Racing" stands as a whimsical and comedic testament to the creative potential of Twitch as a gaming platform. As an absurdist take on competitive racing games, it allowed players to not only spectate but actively participate in turtle races through an inventive use of Twitch chat commands.

The game operated on a simple yet engaging premise: between races, turtles were presented for purchase, allowing players to acquire and enter their own champions into upcoming events. While betting was open, live odds fluctuated in real-time, akin to traditional horse racing, adding a layer of strategic gambling to the gameplay.

### Development and Learning

In the spirit of open-source collaboration, the game's codebase is freely available on GitHub. This openness extended to sharing the development journey; I delivered a talk at a local Unity developer meetup to shed light on the intricacies of Twitch integration, offering insights into how such a live, interactive system could be orchestrated.

### Conclusion

"Twitch Plays Turtle Racing" was a social experiment, a blend of gaming and live entertainment, where the platform of the game is Twitch itself.
