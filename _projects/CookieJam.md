On the mega-hit Cookie Jam, I designed engaging levels that balanced difficulty and encouraged player experimentation, resulting in increased purchases and player retention. For the launch of Cookie Jam Blast, I iterated on mechanics and crafted early levels that tutorialized the new modes in the sequel. As a level tuner, I conducted thorough final reviews of a team of designers levels to ensure reliable and timely delivery of weekly content updates to millions of players.

I was particularly proud to have streamlined repetitive design team tasks through the programming of Google Sheet formulas, allowing the team to spend more time focused on creating fun levels with just the right difficulty. I also developed design specifications for live event features and worked with cross-disciplinary teams throughout development and deployment on new systems that boosted KPIs and enhanced player engagement.
