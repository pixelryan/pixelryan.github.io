In my role as a technical designer for the critically acclaimed Red Dead Redemption, I specialized in ambient design, shaping the open world's dynamic and immersive environment. As the primary designer utilizing the game’s in-house state machine tool, I became the central figure in orchestrating all animations for various game elements—ranging from player controls and AI behaviors to mission-specific animations and multiplayer features.

Working closely with animation programmers and engineers, I facilitated necessary modifications to the state machine tool to support our ambitious design goals. I engineered complex state machines that controlled the natural actions of animals and the daily routines of NPCs, such as bartenders and blacksmiths. These characters interacted seamlessly with world props, triggering sounds and particle effects, engaging in their tasks with a high level of realism. My focus was on eliminating animation pops, ensuring that every movement was fluid and perfectly aligned with the physical elements of the game environment.

Furthermore, I mentored and elevated two QA team members to design roles, training them in state machine management and overseeing their contributions to the project. This role demanded not only technical skill but also a creative vision to breathe life into the game’s world. I ensured that NPCs could dynamically interrupt their activities and react to player interactions without breaking immersion. My efforts in developing these systems played a crucial role in creating the vivid, believable world of Red Dead Redemption that players praised for its depth and authenticity.
